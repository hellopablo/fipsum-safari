## About Fipsum

Fipsum is a simple browser extension which populates fields with dummy data which is appropriate for the type of input. This port exists because[@dustinsenos'](http://github.com/dustinsenos) version seems to no longer be maintained/available.

For an example of Fipsum (for Chrome, but is basically the same) in action, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL3KEP0_F7Y).
